USBzii is a standard platform that has low-cost but high performance sensor technology in a convenient form factor that is easy to carry around with your keys. The intention is to provide the user with quick way of accessing data about their surroundings.

It consists of an USB memory stick sized PCB that contains a microprocessor that can communicate over a USB serial port to a host PC. The majority of the PCB is an empty area for display LEDs and sensor IC(s).

The USB connection can just provide power to the USBzii device which contains LEDs onboard to display the sensor value in real time (usually in binary). Optionally the user can plug it into their PC and access the USBzii serial port to get the data on their PC in real time.

USBziis in the development pipeline include temperature (Tempezii), barometric pressure (Presszii) and spirit level (Levelzii). There is the potential later for humidity, gamma radiation, colour and sound pressure level USBziis.
