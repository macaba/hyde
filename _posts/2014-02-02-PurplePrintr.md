The PurplePrintr is a 3D printer, an open-source tool for printing 3D CAD models in many different plastics, usually PLA & ABS.

The design is based on the Rostock which is colloquially known as a 'delta' printer.

### Desires

When designing the PurplePrintr, there were some key objectives that I wanted to achieve.

* Use as many off-the-shelf parts as possible
* Sparingly use 3d printed parts, don't depend on them
* Make the assembly time as short as possible with only a few different bolt sizes
* Flexibility to change it into place & place, CNC milling/routing, laser/water cutting machines.
* An attractive printer that oozes confidence
