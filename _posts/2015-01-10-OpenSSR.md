title: OpenSSR
---
I decided to start an Open Source Solid State Relay project because I find myself needing to switch high power loads fairly often. 
The existing low-cost solution is often to get a Chinese cloned Fotek SSR which is quite bulky and has questionable quality. The answer? Roll my own.

The aim is to get the cost under £5 for the 10A and 20A versions and under £8 for a 35A version.

I have made a careful selection of parts which will give a AC/DC switching capability, AC (42V) or DC (60V) at 10A, 20A or 35A. All through-hole parts.

The circuit is full of protection: current limiting (to 10A/20A/35A), over-temperature cut-out, over-voltage protection.

My current schematic is:

To be added to schematic:
- Status indicating LEDs
- Correct R3 to be calculated to maximise switching time

Tentative specification:
- 60V DC, 42V AC
- Current limiting to 10A/20A/35A
- Over-temperature protection
- Over-voltage protection
- 7-35V V+ on input side
- Reverse polarity protection on input side
- 2V or better input threshold voltage on Vctrl
- High switching speed; supports PWM upto 10khz

Prototype PCB to evaluate all the parts:
